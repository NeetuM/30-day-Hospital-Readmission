# 30-day-Hospital-Readmission
The data assesses the clinical database of more than 100,000 patients suffering from diabetes,including the onset of diabetes and during diabetes. The dataset analysis talks about hyperglycemia(HbA1c)-a sign that marks the onset of diabetes0020(diabetes1 and diabetes2) which when managed can affect the morbidity and mortality of the inpatient that has been hospitalized and readmission.  The analysis explains a correlation between HbA1c measurement and readmission rates of the patients. Prediction on the dataset can help to identify the reduction in readmission rates based on the measurement of the HbA1c factor.
